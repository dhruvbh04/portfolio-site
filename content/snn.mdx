## Problem

Conventional frame-based neural networks process redundant information in static frames, leading to high energy consumption and latency. The goal was to build a gesture recognition system that processes asynchronous event streams from a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), leveraging the temporal precision of spiking neural networks.

## System Architecture

The pipeline follows a neuromorphic-native design:

- **Input**: DVS event streams (polarity, x, y, timestamp)
- **Encoding**: Temporal spike encoding to convert events into spike trains
- **Network**: Multi-layer SNN with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
- **Training**: Surrogate gradient descent using snntorch
- **Output**: Spike rate decoding for classification

## Technical Decisions

**snntorch over NEST/Brian2** — Selected for GPU-accelerated training and seamless PyTorch integration. The surrogate gradient approach enables backpropagation through non-differentiable spike functions.

**Temporal Encoding** — Events are binned into temporal windows and converted to spike trains, preserving the microsecond-level timing information that makes DVS superior to frame cameras for motion tasks.

**LIF Neuron Model** — Chosen for computational efficiency while retaining biologically relevant dynamics. The membrane potential decay constant was tuned to match the temporal statistics of gesture events.

## Challenges

- **Class imbalance**: Some gestures produced significantly fewer events. Addressed through temporal augmentation (random time shifts and polarity flips).
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: SNN training is sensitive to membrane time constants and threshold values. Implemented a systematic sweep using Optuna.
- **Vanishing spikes**: Deep SNN layers can silence due to information loss. Used residual connections adapted for spike-based computation.

## Results

- Achieved 92.4% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset
- 10x reduction in computational operations compared to equivalent ANN
- Sub-millisecond inference latency suitable for real-time applications

## What I Learned

Working with spiking neural networks fundamentally changed how I think about neural computation. The shift from rate-based to timing-based information processing reveals that biological intelligence is far more elegant and efficient than our standard deep learning paradigms suggest.
