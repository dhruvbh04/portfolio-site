## Problem

Threshold voltage (Vth) is a critical parameter in MOSFET design that determines switching behavior, leakage current, and overall circuit performance. Traditional physics-based models require extensive characterization for each device variant. The goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts Vth across different device architectures using measurable physical parameters.

## System Architecture

A supervised regression pipeline:

- **Data**: Collected from device simulations and published measurement datasets across multiple MOSFET architectures (planar, FinFET, GAA)
- **Features**: Gate oxide thickness, channel doping, gate length, fin width, temperature, etc.
- **Models**: Evaluated Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks
- **Validation**: Device-agnostic cross-validation — train on some architectures, test on unseen ones

## Technical Decisions

**Feature Engineering** — Physical scaling relationships (e.g., oxide capacitance = ε/tox) were used to create derived features that encode known semiconductor physics, improving model generalization.

**Gradient Boosting** — Selected as the primary model after systematic comparison. Its ability to capture nonlinear interactions between device parameters matched the complex physics of threshold voltage.

**Device-Agnostic Validation** — Rather than random train/test splits, the validation strategy held out entire device architectures to test true generalization capability.

## Challenges

- **Scale diversity**: Feature values span orders of magnitude (nm to μm, 10^15 to 10^18 cm^-3 doping). Careful normalization was essential.
- **Limited data**: High-fidelity measurements are expensive. Used physics-informed data augmentation to expand the training set.
- **Interpretability**: Semiconductor engineers require model interpretability. SHAP analysis was used to verify that the model learned physically meaningful relationships.

## Results

- Mean Absolute Error of 12mV across device architectures
- Successfully predicted Vth for unseen FinFET geometries
- SHAP analysis confirmed physically consistent feature importance

## What I Learned

This project demonstrated that machine learning can complement — not replace — physics-based modeling. The most effective approach was embedding domain knowledge into the ML pipeline (feature engineering, validation strategy) rather than relying purely on data-driven learning.
